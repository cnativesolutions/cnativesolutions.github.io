If you ever looked at DevOps job market. You notice majority of companies are looking for Senior DevOps Engineers.
There are many obvious reasons for this matter. We will talk some of those easy to guess reasons alongside of 
some other lesser known reasons.

Experience is the most expensive talent companies looking. Modern technology evolving so fast. Companies trying to 
keep up with the pace would like to hire experienced engineers. 

In rare cases some companies have junior DevOps positions open and they go away fast. Entry level positions have ample 
amount of supply compare to the demand.

Above are some of the common easy to guess observations. I would like to talk about insights and other reasons why
businesses want Senior DevOps Engineers. 

First, let's talk about responsibilities of DevOps Engineers. If we look at responsibilities of DevOps Engineer, it includes almost ultimate
administrative privileges. DevOps Engineers are responsible to build and maintain whole infrastructure. Responsible
for securing and updating all the infrastructure and tools. DevOps Engineers own the most critical technology building blocks
of the business. DevOps Engineers have to carry great responsibility along their day to day tasks.
Size of DevOps Engineer's responsibilities force businesses to look for experienced Engineers.
It is always hard to trust all these business critical tasks to non Senior Engineers. Even small mistake could cost 
businesses thousands of dollars in very short amount of time.
 
There is greater chance DevOps Engineer could make a mistake
and cause more damage than others. For these reasons, majority of companies have no choice but look for experienced 
DevOps Engineers.
