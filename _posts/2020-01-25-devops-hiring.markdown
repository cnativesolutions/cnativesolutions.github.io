If you ever looked at DevOps job market. You notice majority of companies are looking for Senior DevOps Engineers.
There are many obvious reasons for this matter. We will talk some of those easy to guess reasons alongside of 
some other lesser known reasons.


Experience is the most expensive talent companies looking. Modern technology evolving so fast. Companies trying to 
keep up with the pace would like to hire experienced engineers. 


In rare cases some companies have junior DevOps positions open and they go away fast. Entry level positions have ample 
amount of supply compare to the demand.


Above are some of the common easy to guess observations. I would like to talk about insights and other reasons why
businesses want Senior DevOps Engineers. 


First, let's talk about responsibilities of DevOps Engineers. 

- Almost ultimate administrative privileges. 
- Build and maintain whole infrastructure. 
- Responsible for securing and updating all the infrastructure and tools. 
- Owning the most critical technology building blocks of the businesses. 
- Carry great responsibility alongside their day to day tasks.


It is always hard to trust all these business critical tasks to non Senior Engineers. Even small mistake could cost 
businesses thousands of dollars in very short amount of time. There is greater chance DevOps Engineer could make a mistake
and cause more damage compare to others. Size of DevOps Engineer's responsibilities force businesses to look for an experienced engineers. 


In conclusion, neither job listings nor requirements for DevOps Engineers should demotivate anyone. 
If you interested in becoming DevOps Engineer, give it a try. There are many opportunities if you are interested.
You can even get into other Engineering positions then transition to the DevOps team as well. Never give up, every
Senior Engineer also was in your shoes not a long ago.
